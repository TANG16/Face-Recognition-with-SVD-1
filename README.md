# Face-Recognition-with-SVD
It is the project of Scientific Computation Course, May 2019.
This Algorithm recognize the human face from other objects.
 If the tested image is for human, it will find the owner of the image even with different face impression. 
 To run the code, first run the traindata.m and then mention the tested image in 
recognize.m and run it to see the interesing result of this learning.
